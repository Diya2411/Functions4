        "Answer- Difference between interpreted and compiled languages:\n",
        "\n",
        "->Interpreted Languages: In interpreted languages, the code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter. Examples: Python, JavaScript.\n",
        "\n",

        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Exception handling in Python: Exception handling in Python is done using try, except, else, and finally blocks. It helps manage runtime errors by allowing the programmer to define how errors should be handled, making the program more robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "Answer- Purpose of the finally block in exception handling: The finally block is executed no matter what, whether an exception is raised or not. It is typically used to clean up resources, like closing files or releasing locks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Logging in Python: Logging in Python refers to the process of recording events, errors, and informational messages during the execution of a program. The logging module provides a flexible framework for logging in Python programs.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Else block: (Optional) Code that runs if no exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "->Finally block: Code that always runs, used for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Memory management is crucial to ensure efficient use of resources, prevent memory leaks, and optimize the program’s performance, particularly in large-scale applications. Python handles this automatically but still requires awareness of potential issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "Answer- The try block is used to enclose code that might raise an exception, while the except block is used to handle the exception gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Answer- Python uses automatic garbage collection via reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free up memory occupied by objects no longer in use. The gc module can be used to interact with the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "Answer- The else block runs if no exception occurs in the try block. It is used for code that should only execute when the try block succeeds.\n",

        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "Answer- ->os.fork(): Creates a child process by duplicating the current process, available only on Unix-based systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "->multiprocessing: A cross-platform module that creates separate processes with their own memory space, making it more portable and flexible than os.fork().\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Closing a file releases system resources, ensures data is written properly, and prevents file corruption or memory leaks. The with open() statement is commonly used as it closes the file automatically.\n",

        "raise ValueError(\"Invalid input!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "Answer- Multithreading improves performance in applications that require parallel execution, such as handling multiple client requests in a server, background tasks, and real-time processing. However, due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), it is most effective for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks.\n",
